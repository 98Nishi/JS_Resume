# This Resume Created with JavaScript and DOM

This project showcases the creation of a resume using JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM) without using HTML. The resume is dynamically generated and presented on the web page.

## Getting Started

To view this resume, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The JavaScript code dynamically generates the resume content using DOM manipulation techniques.

## About the Project
